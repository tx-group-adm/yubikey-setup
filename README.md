This is a guide to using [YubiKey](https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-hardware/) as a [SmartCard](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/38924/how-does-storing-gpg-ssh-private-keys-on-smart-cards-compare-to-plain-usb-drives) for storing GPG encryption, signing and authentication keys, which can also be used for SSH. Many of the principles in this document are applicable to other smart card devices.

Keys stored on YubiKey are [non-exportable](https://support.yubico.com/support/solutions/articles/15000010242-can-i-duplicate-or-back-up-a-yubikey-) (as opposed to file-based keys that are stored on disk) and are convenient for everyday use. Instead of having to remember and enter passphrases to unlock SSH/GPG keys, YubiKey needs only a physical touch after being unlocked with a PIN code. All signing and encryption operations happen on the card, rather than in OS memory.

# Required software

**macOS**

Download and install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and the following Brew packages:

```console
$ brew install gnupg yubikey-personalization hopenpgp-tools ykman pinentry-mac
```

**Windows**

Download and install [Gpg4Win](https://www.gpg4win.org/) and [PuTTY](https://putty.org).

You may also need more recent versions of [yubikey-personalization](https://developers.yubico.com/yubikey-personalization/Releases/) and [yubico-c](https://developers.yubico.com/yubico-c/Releases/).

# Creating keys

Create a temporary directory which will be cleared on [reboot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tmpfs):

```console
$ export GNUPGHOME=$(mktemp -d)

$ cd $GNUPGHOME
```

Create a hardened configuration in the temporary directory with the following options:

```console
$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drduh/config/master/gpg.conf -o gpg.conf

$ grep -ve "^#" $GNUPGHOME/gpg.conf
personal-cipher-preferences AES256 AES192 AES
personal-digest-preferences SHA512 SHA384 SHA256
personal-compress-preferences ZLIB BZIP2 ZIP Uncompressed
default-preference-list SHA512 SHA384 SHA256 AES256 AES192 AES ZLIB BZIP2 ZIP Uncompressed

```

Disable networking for the remainder of the setup.

# Master key

The first key to generate is the master key. It will be used for certification only: to issue sub-keys that are used for encryption, signing and authentication.

**Important** The master key should be kept offline at all times and only accessed to revoke or issue new sub-keys. Keys can also be generated on the YubiKey itself to ensure no other copies exist.

You'll be prompted to enter and verify a passphrase - keep it handy as you'll need it multiple times later.

To generate a strong passphrase which could be written down in a hidden or secure place; or memorized:

```console
$ gpg --gen-random -a 0 24
ydOmByxmDe63u7gqx2XI9eDgpvJwibNH
```

On Linux or OpenBSD, select the password with the mouse to copy it to the clipboard and paste using the middle mouse button or `Shift`-`Insert`.

Generate a new key with GPG, selecting `(8) RSA (set your own capabilities)`, `Certify` capability only and `4096` bit key size.

Do not set the master key to expire - see [Note #3](#notes).

```console
$ gpg --expert --full-generate-key

Please select what kind of key you want:
   (1) RSA and RSA (default)
   (2) DSA and Elgamal
   (3) DSA (sign only)
   (4) RSA (sign only)
   (7) DSA (set your own capabilities)

Select a name and email address - neither has to be valid nor existing.

```console
GnuPG needs to construct a user ID to identify your key.

Real name: Benjamin Vonlanthen
Email address: benjamin.vonlanthen@tamedia.ch
Comment: [Optional - leave blank]
You selected this USER-ID:
    "Benjamin Vonlanthen <benjamin.vonlanthen@tamedia.ch>"

Change (N)ame, (C)omment, (E)mail or (O)kay/(Q)uit? o

We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.

Export the key ID as a [variable](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1158091/defining-a-variable-with-or-without-export/1158231#1158231) (`KEYID`) for use later:

```console
$ export KEYID=0xFF3E7D88647EBCDB
```

# Sign with an existing key (optional)

If you already have a pgp key you may want to sign your new key
with the old one to help prove that your new key is infact controlled
by you.

Export your existing key to move it to the working keyring.  From a
different terminal do:

```console
$ gpg --export-secret-keys --armor --output /tmp/new.sec
```

to export your old key and then


```console
$ gpg  --default-key $OLDKEY --sign-key $KEYID
```

# Sub-keys

Edit the master key to add sub-keys:

```console
$ gpg --expert --edit-key $KEYID

Secret key is available.

Use 4096-bit key sizes.

Use a 1 year expiration for sub-keys - they can be renewed using the offline master key. See [rotating keys](#rotating-keys).

## Signing

Create a [signing key](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5421107/can-rsa-be-both-used-as-encryption-and-signature/5432623#5432623) by selecting `(4) RSA (sign only)`:

```console
gpg> addkey
Key is protected.

You need a passphrase to unlock the secret key for

## Encryption

Next, create an [encryption key](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs5430/2015sp/notes/rsa_sign_vs_dec.php) by selecting `(6) RSA (encrypt only)`:

```console
gpg> addkey

## Authentication

Finally, create an [authentication key](https://superuser.com/questions/390265/what-is-a-gpg-with-authenticate-capability-used-for).

GPG doesn't provide an authenticate-only key type, so select `(8) RSA (set your own capabilities)` and toggle the required capabilities until the only allowed action is `Authenticate`:

```console
gpg> addkey
Please select what kind of key you want:
   (3) DSA (sign only)
   (4) RSA (sign only)
   (5) Elgamal (encrypt only)
   (6) RSA (encrypt only)

```

Add any additional identities or email addresses you wish to associate using the `adduid` command.

**Tip** Verify with a OpenPGP [key best practice checker](https://riseup.net/en/security/message-security/openpgp/best-practices#openpgp-key-checks):

```console
$ gpg --export $KEYID | hokey lint
```

The output will display any problems with your key in red text. If everything is green, your key passes each of the tests. If it is red, your key has failed one of the tests.

> hokey may warn (orange text) about cross certification for the authentication key. GPG's [Signing Subkey Cross-Certification](https://gnupg.org/faq/subkey-cross-certify.html) documentation has more detail on cross certification, and gpg v2.2.1 notes "subkey <keyid> does not sign and so does not need to be cross-certified". hokey may also indicate a problem (red text) with `Key expiration times: []` on the primary key (see [Note #3](#notes) about not setting an expiry for the primary key).

# Export

The master key and sub-keys will be encrypted with your passphrase when exported.

Save a copy of your keys:

```console
$ gpg --armor --export-secret-keys $KEYID > $GNUPGHOME/mastersub.key

$ gpg --armor --export-secret-subkeys $KEYID > $GNUPGHOME/sub.key
```

On Windows, note that using any extension other than `.gpg` or attempting IO redirection to a file will garble the secret key, making it impossible to import it again at a later date:

```console
$ gpg -o \path\to\dir\mastersub.gpg --armor --export-secret-keys $KEYID

$ gpg -o \path\to\dir\sub.gpg --armor --export-secret-subkeys $KEYID
```

# Backup

Upload the public key to a [public keyserver](https://debian-administration.org/article/451/Submitting_your_GPG_key_to_a_keyserver):

```console
$ gpg --keyserver hkps://keyserver.ubuntu.com:443 --send-key $KEYID
```

After some time, the public key will to propagate to [other](https://pgp.key-server.io/pks/lookup?search=doc%40duh.to&fingerprint=on&op=vindex) [servers](https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?search=doc%40duh.to&op=index).

# Configure Smartcard

**Windows** Use the [YubiKey Manager](https://developers.yubico.com/yubikey-manager) application (note, this not the similarly named older YubiKey NEO Manager) to enable CCID functionality.

Use GPG to configure YubiKey as a smartcard:

```console
$ gpg --card-edit
Reader ...........: Yubico Yubikey 4 OTP U2F CCID
Application ID ...: D2760001240102010006055532110000

```

## Change PIN

The default PIN is `123456` and default Admin PIN (PUK) is `12345678`. CCID-mode PINs can be up to 127 ASCII characters.

The Admin PIN is required for some card operations and to unblock a PIN that has been entered incorrectly more than three times. See the GnuPG documentation on [Managing PINs](https://www.gnupg.org/howtos/card-howto/en/ch03s02.html) for details.

# Transfer keys

**Important** Transferring keys to YubiKey using `keytocard` is a destructive, one-way operation only. Make sure you've made a backup before proceeding: `keytocard` converts the local, on-disk key into a stub, which means the on-disk copy is no longer usable to transfer to subsequent security key devices or mint additional keys.

Previous GPG versions required the `toggle` command before selecting keys. The currently selected key(s) are indicated with an `*`. When moving keys only one key should be selected at a time.

```console
$ gpg --edit-key $KEYID

Secret key is available.

# Cleanup

Ensure you have:

* Saved the encryption, signing and authentication sub-keys to YubiKey.
* Saved the YubiKey PINs which you changed from defaults.
* Saved the password to the master key.
* Saved a copy of the master key, sub-keys and revocation certificates on an encrypted volume, to be stored offline.
* Saved the password to that encrypted volume in a separate location.
* Saved a copy of the public key somewhere easily accessible later.

Reboot or [securely delete](http://srm.sourceforge.net/) `$GNUPGHOME` and remove the secret keys from the GPG keyring:

```console
$ sudo srm -r $GNUPGHOME || sudo rm -rf $GNUPGHOME

$ gpg --delete-secret-key $KEYID
```

**Important** Make sure you have securely erased all generated keys and revocation certificates if an ephemeral enviroment was not used!

# Using keys

Download [drduh/config/gpg.conf](https://github.com/drduh/config/blob/master/gpg.conf):

```console
$ cd ~/.gnupg ; wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drduh/config/master/gpg.conf

$ chmod 600 gpg.conf
```

Download the public key from a keyserver:

```console
$ gpg --keyserver hkps://keyserver.ubuntu.com:443 --recv $KEYID
gpg: requesting key 0xFF3E7D88647EBCDB from hkps server hkps.pool.sks-keyservers.net
[...]
gpg: key 0xFF3E7D88647EBCDB: public key "Benjamin Vonlanthen <benjamin.vonlanthen@tamedia.ch>" imported
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1
```

Edit the master key to assign it ultimate trust by selecting `trust` and `5`:

```console
$ export KEYID=0xFF3E7D88647EBCDB

$ gpg --edit-key $KEYID

gpg> trust

`sec#` indicates master key is not available (as it should be stored encrypted offline).

**Note** If you see `General key info..: [none]` in the output instead - go back and import the public key using the previous step.

Encrypt a message to your own key (useful for storing password credentials and other data):

```console
$ echo "test message string" | gpg --encrypt --armor --recipient $KEYID -o encrypted.txt
```

To encrypt to multiple recipients (or to multiple keys):

```console
$ echo "test message string" | gpg --encrypt --armor --recipient $KEYID_0 --recipient $KEYID_1 --recipient $KEYID_2 -o encrypted.txt
```

Decrypt the message:

```console
$ gpg --decrypt --armor encrypted.txt
gpg: anonymous recipient; trying secret key 0x0000000000000000 ...
gpg: okay, we are the anonymous recipient.
gpg: encrypted with RSA key, ID 0x0000000000000000
test message string
```

Sign a message:

```console
$ echo "test message string" | gpg --armor --clearsign > signed.txt
```

Verify the signature:

```console
$ gpg --verify signed.txt
gpg: Signature made Wed 25 May 2016 00:00:00 AM UTC
gpg:                using RSA key 0xBECFA3C1AE191D15

# GitHub

You can use YubiKey to sign GitHub commits and tags. It can also be used for GitHub SSH authentication, allowing you to push, pull, and commit without a password.

Login to GitHub and upload SSH and PGP public keys in Settings.

To configure a signing key:

	> git config --global user.signingkey $KEYID

Make sure the user.email option matches the email address associated with the PGP identity.

Now, to sign commits or tags simply use the `-S` option. GPG will automatically query YubiKey and prompt you for a PIN.

To authenticate:

**Windows**

Run the following command:

	> git config --global core.sshcommand 'plink -agent'

You can then change the repository url to `git@github.com:USERNAME/repository` and any authenticated commands will be authorized by YubiKey.

**Note** If you encounter the error `gpg: signing failed: No secret key` - run `gpg --card-status` with YubiKey plugged in and try the git command again.

# Require touch

**Note** This is not possible on YubiKey NEO.

By default, YubiKey will perform encryption, signing and authentication operations without requiring any action from the user, after the key is plugged in and first unlocked with the PIN.

To require a touch for each key operation, install [YubiKey Manager](https://developers.yubico.com/yubikey-manager/) and recall the Admin PIN:

**Note** Older versions of the YubiKey Manager used `touch` instead of `set-touch` in the below commands.

Authentication:

```console
$ ykman openpgp set-touch aut on
```

Signing:

```console
$ ykman openpgp set-touch sig on
```

Encryption:

```console
$ ykman openpgp set-touch enc on
```

YubiKey will blink when it is waiting for a touch.

# Reset

If PIN attempts are exceeded, the card is locked and must be [reset](https://developers.yubico.com/ykneo-openpgp/ResetApplet.html) and set up again using the encrypted backup.

Copy the following script to a file and run `gpg-connect-agent -r $file` to lock and terminate the card. Then re-insert YubiKey to reset.

```console
/hex
scd serialno
scd apdu 00 20 00 81 08 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40
